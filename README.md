 This repository contains the solution for the Fawry Rise Full Stack Development Internship Challenge. 
### Architecture
**Package by Layer:** 

The project is organized into a clear package structure
  - `models`: Contains plain data-holding objects (POJOs).
  - `interfaces`: Defines the capabilities (like being shippable or expirable).
  - `services`: Holds all the business logic and operations.
> [!NOTE]
> Unit tests have been added to cover core business logic and edge cases.
